# ðŸŽ¯ Multiplayer Number Guessing Game (Backend - Rust)

A **real-time multiplayer number guessing game** backend built in **Rust**, using [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/) and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) for high-performance async handling.  
Players connect via WebSockets to compete in guessing a secret number in the fewest attempts possible.  

> This project was created as a learning initiative to gain hands-on experience with Rust backend development, WebSocket communication, and modern async programming.
